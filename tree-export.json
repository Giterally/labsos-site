Significant differences in foraging were detected for comparisons of None vs Medium, None vs High, Low vs High, and Medium vs High (Table 1). In each case, more material was consumed in the tissue with oil higher exposure (Fig 2). In general, shrimp consumed between 5 and 30% of material during trials, within the optimal range for foraging trials [32].\n\nAmphipods also showed similar trends in consumption preferences, albeit with less amount of material consumed than grass shrimp (generally less than 10% of material consumed). Significant preferences (Table 1, Fig 3) were detected for the following comparisons: None vs High, Low vs High, and Medium vs High. Again, herbivores preferred plant tissue that had been grown under higher oil concentrations.",

However, amphipods consumed very little tissue during these trials (2.3% in no oil, and around 1% in other treatments).
