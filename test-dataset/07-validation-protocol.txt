4. Data collection during annealing step

Step 4: Data Analysis
1. Calculate ΔCt = Ct(target) - Ct(housekeeping)
2. Calculate ΔΔCt = ΔCt(sample) - ΔCt(calibrator)
3. Calculate fold change = 2^(-ΔΔCt)
4. Perform statistical analysis (t-test, ANOVA)

4. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 minutes
5. Collect supernatant
6. Quantify protein using BCA assay

Step 2: SDS-PAGE
1. Load 30μg protein per lane
2. Run on 4-20% gradient gel at 120V
3. Transfer to PVDF membrane at 100V for 1 hour
4. Block membrane with 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour

Step 3: Antibody Incubation
1. Incubate with primary antibody overnight at 4°C
2. Wash 3 times with TBST for 10 minutes each
3. Incubate with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature
4. Wash 3 times with TBST for 10 minutes each

Step 4: Detection
1. Apply ECL detection reagents
2. Image using chemiluminescence imager
3. Quantify band intensity using ImageJ
4. Normalize to loading control (GAPDH or β-actin)

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

Correlation Analysis:
1. Calculate Pearson correlation between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR
