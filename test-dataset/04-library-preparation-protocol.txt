QUALITY CONTROL:

Library Quantification:
- Measure concentration using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay
- Expected concentration: 2-10 ng/μl
- Expected total yield: 50-200 ng

Library Size Distribution:
- Run on Bioanalyzer using High Sensitivity DNA kit
- Expected size: 200-500 bp
- Peak should be around 300-350 bp
- No adapter dimers visible

Library Pooling:
- Normalize libraries to 4 nM concentration
- Pool equal volumes of each library
- Final pool concentration: 4 nM
- Submit 20μl for sequencing

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Low Library Yield:
- Check RNA input quality and quantity
- Verify all reagents are fresh
- Ensure proper incubation times
- Check for contamination

Adapter Dimers:
- Increase bead ratio for cleanup
- Extend cleanup incubation time
- Consider gel-based size selection
- Check adapter concentration

Size Distribution Issues:
- Verify fragmentation conditions
- Check bead cleanup efficiency
- Ensure proper PCR cycle number
- Verify Bioanalyzer analysis

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Library concentration: 2-10 ng/μl
- Library size: 200-500 bp (peak ~300-350 bp)
- Total yield: 50-200 ng
- No adapter dimers
- Ready for sequencing

STORAGE:
- Store libraries at -20°C
- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles
- Use within 1 month of preparation
- Document all quality control results
