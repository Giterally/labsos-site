OVERVIEW:
This protocol describes the sequencing of RNA-seq libraries on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, optimized for differential gene expression analysis with high coverage and quality.

SEQUENCING SPECIFICATIONS:
- Platform: Illumina NovaSeq 6000
- Read Type: Paired-end (2x150 bp)
- Target Depth: 50 million reads per sample
- Flow Cell: S4 (highest output)
- Run Time: ~24 hours
- Expected Output: 2.5-3 billion reads per flow cell

MATERIALS REQUIRED:
- Pooled RNA-seq libraries (4 nM concentration)
- NovaSeq 6000 Reagent Kit (S4)
- NovaSeq 6000 Flow Cell (S4)
- Cluster Generation Kit
- Sequencing Kit
- PhiX Control v3
- HT1 Buffer
- 0.2N NaOH
- 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0

PRE-SEQUENCING PREPARATION:

Library Pool Preparation:
1. Normalize all libraries to 4 nM concentration
2. Pool equal volumes of each library
3. Final pool should contain 40 libraries (20 cancer + 20 normal)
4. Add PhiX Control v3 at 1% final concentration
5. Final pool concentration: 4 nM
6. Volume: 20μl per lane

Flow Cell Preparation:
1. Remove flow cell from -20°C storage
2. Allow to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes
3. Inspect flow cell for any visible defects
4. Load flow cell into NovaSeq 6000 instrument
5. Initialize instrument and perform system checks

CLUSTER GENERATION:

Step 1: Library Denaturation
1. Dilute library pool to 2 nM with HT1 Buffer
2. Add 0.2N NaOH to denature libraries
3. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
4. Neutralize with 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0
5. Dilute to final loading concentration of 200 pM

Step 2: Cluster Generation
1. Load denatured libraries into flow cell
2. Start cluster generation process
3. Monitor cluster density in real-time
4. Target cluster density: 200-250 K/mm²
5. Cluster generation time: ~6 hours

Step 3: Quality Control
1. Perform first base incorporation (FBI) check
2. Verify cluster density and quality
3. Check for over-clustering or under-clustering
4. Proceed to sequencing if quality metrics pass

SEQUENCING RUN:

Step 1: Sequencing Setup
1. Load sequencing reagents
2. Configure run parameters:
   - Read 1: 150 cycles
   - Index 1: 8 cycles
   - Index 2: 8 cycles
   - Read 2: 150 cycles
3. Set quality score threshold to Q30
4. Enable real-time analysis

Step 2: Sequencing Execution
1. Start sequencing run
2. Monitor run progress and quality metrics
3. Check for any error messages or warnings
4. Expected run time: ~18 hours
5. Monitor data generation rate

Step 3: Data Quality Monitoring
1. Check Q30 scores in real-time
2. Monitor cluster density and pass filter rates
3. Verify index demultiplexing accuracy
4. Check for any lane failures or issues
5. Document all quality metrics

POST-SEQUENCING ANALYSIS:

Data Demultiplexing:
1. Use Illumina bcl2fastq software
2. Demultiplex samples based on index sequences
3. Generate FASTQ files for each sample
4. Perform quality control checks
5. Generate sequencing summary reports

Quality Control Metrics:
- Q30 score: >80% of bases
- Cluster density: 200-250 K/mm²
- Pass filter rate: >75%
- Index demultiplexing accuracy: >95%
- Read length: 150 bp for both reads

Expected Output per Sample:
- Read 1: ~50 million reads
- Read 2: ~50 million reads
- Total: ~100 million reads per sample
- File size: ~15-20 GB per sample
