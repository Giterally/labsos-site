RNA EXTRACTION PROTOCOL
========================

PROTOCOL: Total RNA Extraction from Tissue Samples Using TRIzol Method
VERSION: 2.1
DATE: January 20, 2024
VALIDATED BY: Dr. Jennifer Liu

OVERVIEW:
This protocol describes the extraction of high-quality total RNA from tissue samples using TRIzol reagent, optimized for downstream RNA-seq applications.

PRINCIPLE:
TRIzol is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate that simultaneously solubilizes biological material and denatures proteins. The addition of chloroform creates a biphasic solution, allowing separation of RNA from DNA and proteins.

MATERIALS AND REAGENTS:
- TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Cat. #15596026)
- Chloroform (molecular biology grade)
- Isopropanol (molecular biology grade)
- 75% Ethanol (prepared with DEPC-treated water)
- DEPC-treated water
- RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes
- RNase-free pipette tips
- Tissue homogenizer (Polytron or similar)
- Refrigerated centrifuge
- Nanodrop spectrophotometer
- Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100)

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
- Work in fume hood when using TRIzol and chloroform
- Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
- TRIzol contains phenol - avoid skin contact
- Chloroform is toxic and volatile - ensure proper ventilation

PROCEDURE:

Phase 1: Tissue Homogenization
1. Remove tissue sample from -80°C storage
2. Place 50-100mg tissue in pre-chilled 2ml tube
3. Add 1ml TRIzol reagent per 50-100mg tissue
4. Homogenize using Polytron at maximum speed for 30 seconds
5. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
6. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
7. Transfer supernatant to new RNase-free tube

Phase 2: Phase Separation
1. Add 0.2ml chloroform per 1ml TRIzol used
2. Cap tube securely and shake vigorously for 15 seconds
3. Incubate at room temperature for 3 minutes
4. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C
5. Three phases should be visible:
   - Upper aqueous phase (RNA)
   - Interphase (DNA)
   - Lower organic phase (proteins)

Phase 3: RNA Precipitation
1. Transfer upper aqueous phase to new tube (avoid interphase)
2. Add 0.5ml isopropanol per 1ml TRIzol used
3. Mix by inversion and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
4. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
5. Remove supernatant carefully

Phase 4: RNA Washing
1. Add 1ml 75% ethanol per 1ml TRIzol used
2. Vortex briefly to resuspend pellet
3. Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C
4. Remove supernatant
5. Repeat wash step once
6. Air dry pellet for 5-10 minutes (do not over-dry)

Phase 5: RNA Resuspension
1. Resuspend pellet in 50-100μl DEPC-treated water
2. Incubate at 55-60°C for 10 minutes to aid dissolution
3. Store at -80°C for long-term storage

QUALITY CONTROL:

RNA Quantification:
- Measure concentration using Nanodrop
- Expected yield: 5-20μg RNA per 100mg tissue
- A260/A280 ratio should be 1.8-2.0
- A260/A230 ratio should be >2.0

RNA Integrity Assessment:
- Run RNA on Bioanalyzer using RNA 6000 Nano kit
- RIN (RNA Integrity Number) should be >7.0
- 28S/18S ratio should be >1.5
- No degradation peaks visible

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Low RNA Yield:
- Increase tissue amount
- Ensure complete homogenization
- Check for RNase contamination
- Verify proper phase separation

Poor RNA Quality:
- Reduce homogenization time
- Use fresh TRIzol reagent
- Ensure proper storage conditions
- Check for DNA contamination

DNA Contamination:
- Increase centrifugation time
- Avoid interphase during transfer
- Consider DNase treatment if necessary

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- RNA concentration: 200-1000 ng/μl
- A260/A280 ratio: 1.8-2.0
- RIN score: >7.0
- Total yield: 5-20μg per sample

STORAGE CONDITIONS:
- Short-term: -20°C for up to 1 month
- Long-term: -80°C for up to 2 years
- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles
- Use RNase-free storage tubes
