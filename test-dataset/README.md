## How to Use This Dataset

1. **Upload All Files**: Upload all 10 text files to the system
2. **Process Files**: Let the AI process and analyze the content
3. **Review Proposals**: Check the generated experiment tree structure
4. **Build Tree**: Accept the proposed nodes and create the experiment tree
5. **Edit and Refine**: Use the editing functionality to modify the tree as needed

## Expected AI Processing

The AI should:
- Extract key experimental steps from each document
- Identify relationships between different procedures
- Group related steps into logical blocks
- Generate detailed node descriptions with 4 slides each
- Provide confidence scores for each proposed node
- Create a comprehensive experiment tree structure

## Quality Expectations

- **Completeness**: All major experimental steps should be captured
- **Accuracy**: Node descriptions should accurately reflect the source content
- **Organization**: Logical grouping of related procedures
- **Detail**: Sufficient detail for experimental reproduction
- **Confidence**: High confidence scores for well-documented procedures

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Complete Workflow**: Upload all files and generate full tree
2. **Partial Upload**: Upload subset of files to test incremental building
3. **Edit Functionality**: Test editing and deletion of generated trees
4. **Validation**: Verify that generated nodes match source content
5. **Performance**: Test with large number of files and complex content

This dataset provides a comprehensive test case for the Experiment Tree Auto-Builder system, covering all aspects of a real research project from planning to results interpretation.
