# Machine Learning Pipeline for Drug Discovery

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline for identifying potential drug candidates using molecular data and biological activity predictions.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather molecular datasets from public repositories
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant molecular descriptors
3. **Model Development**: Build predictive models for drug activity
4. **Validation**: Test models on independent datasets
5. **Deployment**: Create a web interface for predictions

## Expected Outcomes

- A robust ML pipeline for drug discovery
- Validated predictive models with >85% accuracy
- Open-source software package for the research community

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Data collection and preprocessing (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Model development (6 weeks)
- Phase 3: Validation and optimization (4 weeks)
- Phase 4: Documentation and deployment (2 weeks)

## Resources Required

- High-performance computing cluster
- Molecular databases access
- Software licenses for cheminformatics tools
