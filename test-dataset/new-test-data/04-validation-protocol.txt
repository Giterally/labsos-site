VALIDATION PROTOCOL FOR DRUG DISCOVERY ML PIPELINE
==================================================

1. DATA VALIDATION
------------------
   a) SMILES String Validation
      - Check for valid chemical structures
      - Remove duplicates and invalid entries
      - Standardize molecular representations
   
   b) Activity Data Validation
      - Verify IC50 values are within reasonable range (1nM - 100μM)
      - Check for missing values and outliers
      - Ensure consistent units across datasets

2. MODEL VALIDATION
-------------------
   a) Cross-Validation
      - 5-fold stratified cross-validation
      - Ensure balanced representation of classes
      - Monitor for overfitting
   
   b) External Validation
      - Test on completely independent dataset
      - Use different chemical scaffolds
      - Validate on different target proteins

3. PERFORMANCE METRICS
----------------------
   a) Classification Metrics
      - Accuracy: >80%
      - Precision: >75%
      - Recall: >75%
      - F1-Score: >75%
      - AUC-ROC: >0.8
   
   b) Regression Metrics (for IC50 prediction)
      - R²: >0.7
      - RMSE: <1.0 log units
      - MAE: <0.8 log units

4. STATISTICAL VALIDATION
-------------------------
   a) Permutation Testing
      - Randomize labels 1000 times
      - Ensure model performance is significantly better than random
   
   b) Bootstrap Analysis
      - 1000 bootstrap samples
      - Calculate confidence intervals
      - Assess model stability

5. CHEMICAL VALIDATION
----------------------
   a) ADMET Properties
      - Check Lipinski's Rule of Five
      - Verify drug-likeness scores
      - Assess toxicity predictions
   
   b) Chemical Diversity
      - Calculate Tanimoto similarity
      - Ensure diverse chemical space coverage
      - Validate scaffold diversity

6. BIOLOGICAL VALIDATION
------------------------
   a) Literature Validation
      - Compare with known active compounds
      - Verify biological relevance
      - Check for known off-targets
   
   b) Experimental Validation
      - Select top 10 predictions for testing
      - Perform in vitro assays
      - Validate predicted activities

7. VALIDATION TIMELINE
----------------------
   Week 1-2: Data validation and cleaning
   Week 3-4: Model training and cross-validation
   Week 5-6: External validation and statistical tests
   Week 7-8: Chemical and biological validation
   Week 9-10: Experimental validation and reporting

8. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
----------------------
   - All performance metrics meet minimum thresholds
   - Statistical significance confirmed (p < 0.05)
   - Chemical diversity requirements satisfied
   - At least 3 experimental validations successful
   - Documentation complete and reproducible

9. RISK MITIGATION
------------------
   - Multiple model ensemble for robustness
   - Conservative confidence thresholds
   - Regular model retraining with new data
   - Continuous monitoring of performance drift
