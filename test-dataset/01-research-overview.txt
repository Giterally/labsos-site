COMPREHENSIVE RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS WORKFLOW
==========================================

Project: Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Cancer vs Normal Tissues
Principal Investigator: Dr. Sarah Chen
Institution: University of Biomedical Sciences
Date: January 2024

OBJECTIVE:
This research project aims to identify differentially expressed genes between cancer and normal tissue samples using RNA-seq technology. The study will provide insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
- Sample Groups: 20 cancer samples, 20 matched normal samples
- Technology: Illumina NovaSeq 6000, 150bp paired-end reads
- Target Depth: 50M reads per sample
- Quality Control: RIN > 7.0, 260/280 ratio 1.8-2.0

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. Identification of significantly differentially expressed genes
2. Pathway enrichment analysis
3. Protein-protein interaction networks
4. Validation of key findings with qRT-PCR
5. Publication in high-impact journal
