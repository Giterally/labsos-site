SAMPLE COLLECTION PROTOCOL
===========================

PROTOCOL TITLE: Collection of Cancer and Normal Tissue Samples for RNA-seq Analysis
PROTOCOL VERSION: 1.2
EFFECTIVE DATE: January 15, 2024
APPROVED BY: Dr. Sarah Chen, Dr. Michael Rodriguez

PURPOSE:
To establish standardized procedures for collecting, processing, and storing tissue samples for RNA-seq analysis while maintaining RNA integrity and ensuring reproducibility.

MATERIALS REQUIRED:
- Sterile surgical instruments
- RNase-free collection tubes (2ml Eppendorf tubes)
- RNAlater solution (Ambion)
- Liquid nitrogen
- Dry ice
- Sample labels and barcode system
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Cooler with ice packs

PRE-COLLECTION PREPARATION:
1. Verify patient consent and sample collection authorization
2. Prepare sterile workspace with RNase decontamination
3. Label all collection tubes with unique barcodes
4. Pre-chill RNAlater solution to 4째C
5. Prepare liquid nitrogen containers for immediate freezing

COLLECTION PROCEDURE:

Step 1: Tissue Harvesting
- Use sterile surgical instruments for tissue collection
- Collect tissue within 5 minutes of surgical removal
- Take representative samples from both tumor and adjacent normal tissue
- Ensure minimum sample size of 100mg for RNA extraction
- Avoid necrotic or heavily contaminated areas

Step 2: Immediate Processing
- Place tissue sample in pre-labeled 2ml tube
- Add 1ml RNAlater solution immediately
- Ensure tissue is completely submerged
- Mix gently by inversion
- Store at 4째C for 24 hours to allow RNAlater penetration

Step 3: Long-term Storage
- After 24 hours, transfer tubes to -80째C freezer
- Maintain chain of custody documentation
- Store samples in organized rack system
- Backup samples stored in separate -80째C freezer

QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES:
- Visual inspection for tissue integrity
- Documentation of collection time and conditions
- Regular freezer temperature monitoring
- Quarterly sample inventory audits
- Backup power systems for freezers

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If RNAlater not available: Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen
- If sample size insufficient: Collect additional tissue if possible
- If contamination suspected: Use new sterile instruments
- If storage temperature compromised: Transfer to backup freezer

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Sample collection form with patient ID, date, time
- Tissue type and location documentation
- Collector signature and credentials
- Quality control checklist completion
- Chain of custody documentation

SAFETY PROTOCOLS:
- Use appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, face shield)
- Follow hospital infection control procedures
- Dispose of contaminated materials properly
- Report any exposure incidents immediately
- Maintain sterile technique throughout procedure
