PATHWAY ANALYSIS:
- Enriched Pathways (Cancer):
  * Cell cycle regulation (p < 0.001)
  * DNA repair mechanisms (p < 0.001)
  * Apoptosis signaling (p < 0.001)
  * Growth factor signaling (p < 0.001)

- Enriched Pathways (Normal):
  * Metabolic processes (p < 0.001)
  * Immune response (p < 0.001)
  * Tissue homeostasis (p < 0.001)

VALIDATION:
- qRT-PCR validation performed on top 10 genes
- Correlation with RNA-seq: r = 0.89 (p < 0.001)
- Technical replicates: CV < 15%

CONCLUSIONS:
1. Significant differences in gene expression between cancer and normal tissues
2. Cell cycle and DNA repair pathways prominently dysregulated
3. Results consistent with known cancer biology
4. High confidence in differential expression calls

NEXT STEPS:
1. Functional validation of top candidate genes
2. Integration with clinical outcome data
3. Pathway-based drug target identification
4. Biomarker development for diagnostic applications
