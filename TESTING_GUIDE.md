## 🧪 Test Plan

### Test 1: Generate AI Proposals Progress Bar

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to your project's Import page
2. Upload some test files if not already uploaded (or use existing ones)
3. Click **"Generate AI Proposals"** button
4. **Watch for these behaviors:**

#### Expected Results:
✅ Progress bar appears immediately (not stuck at 0%)  
✅ Progress moves smoothly through stages:
   - **0-20%**: "Initializing proposal generation..."
   - **20-40%**: "Analyzing document structure with Planning Agent..."
   - **40-60%**: "Clustering X chunks..."
   - **60-80%**: "Synthesizing nodes: X/Y complete..." (updates multiple times)
   - **80-100%**: "Detecting and merging duplicate nodes..."
   - **100%**: "Generated X proposed nodes successfully"

✅ Loading spinner stops automatically (no manual refresh needed!)  
✅ Proposals appear in the UI without refreshing  
✅ Automatically switches to "Review Proposals" tab  
✅ Success message shows: "Generated X proposed nodes from Y clusters"

#### Console Output to Check:
Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab:
```
[GENERATE] Starting proposal generation...
[PROGRESS_TRACKER] Update: stage=initializing, 0/5 (0%)
[PROGRESS_TRACKER] Update: stage=initializing, 1/5 (20%)
[PROGRESS_TRACKER] Update: stage=clustering, 2/5 (40%)
[PROGRESS_TRACKER] Update: stage=synthesizing, 3/5 (60%)
[PROGRESS_TRACKER] Update: stage=deduplicating, 4/5 (80%)
[PROGRESS_TRACKER] Complete: Generated X nodes successfully (100%)
[GENERATE] Generation complete, fetching updated proposals...
```

### Test 2: Build Tree Progress Bar (NEW!)

**Steps:**
1. Ensure you have proposals from Test 1 (or generate some)
2. Select several proposals (click checkboxes)
3. Click **"Build Tree (X)"** button (where X is the number selected)
4. **Watch for these NEW behaviors:**

#### Expected Results:
✅ Progress bar appears below the button (NEW!)  
✅ Button shows "Building Tree..." with spinner  
✅ Progress moves smoothly through stages:
   - **0-14%**: "Starting tree build..."
   - **14-29%**: "Fetching proposals..."
   - **29-43%**: "Creating experiment tree..."
   - **43-57%**: "Analyzing dependencies and organizing nodes..."
   - **57-71%**: "Creating X workflow blocks..."
   - **71-86%**: "Creating X tree nodes..."
   - **86-100%**: "Creating content for X nodes..."
   - **100%**: "Tree built successfully!"

✅ Progress bar updates every 500ms (fast!)  
✅ Status message updates at each stage  
✅ Success message shows: "Experiment tree created successfully with X nodes!"  
✅ Automatically redirects to tree view page after 1.5 seconds  
✅ Proposals are marked as accepted and disappear from list  
✅ Tree appears on the project page  

#### Console Output to Check:
```
[BUILD TREE] Building tree with X proposals...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 0% Starting tree build...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 14% Fetching proposals...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 29% Creating experiment tree...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 43% Analyzing dependencies...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 57% Creating X workflow blocks...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 71% Creating X tree nodes...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 86% Creating content for X nodes...
[BUILD TREE] Progress: 100% Tree built successfully!
[BUILD TREE] Tree created successfully: {treeId: "...", nodesCreated: X}
```

### Test 3: Error Handling

**Test 3a: No Files Uploaded**
1. Go to a new/empty project
2. Click "Generate AI Proposals" without uploading files
3. **Expected:** Clear error message: "No processed data found. Please ensure files have been successfully uploaded and processed."

**Test 3b: No Proposals Selected**
1. Go to proposals tab
2. Click "Build Tree" with no selections
3. **Expected:** Error message: "Please select at least one proposal to build the tree"

**Test 3c: Backend Failure During Generation**
1. If generation fails mid-process
2. **Expected:** 
   - Progress bar shows error state
   - Clear error message displayed
   - No proposals created

**Test 3d: Backend Failure During Tree Building**
1. If tree building fails mid-process
2. **Expected:**
   - Progress bar shows error state
   - Clear error message displayed
   - **Proposals remain visible** (not deleted!)
   - Can try again

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before Your Fixes:
❌ Proposal generation progress stuck at 0%  
❌ No idea if generation was working or frozen  
❌ Had to manually refresh page to see proposals  
❌ Tree building had NO progress bar at all  
❌ Looked like the app was frozen during tree building  
❌ Proposals disappeared even when tree building failed  

### After Your Fixes:
✅ Proposal generation shows real-time progress 0-100%  
✅ Clear status messages at each stage  
✅ Automatic completion detection and UI update  
✅ Tree building now has a beautiful progress bar  
✅ Real-time updates every 500ms during tree building  
✅ Proposals only deleted after successful tree creation  
✅ Clear error messages if anything fails

## 📊 Technical Details

### Progress Stages

**Proposal Generation (5 stages):**
1. Initializing (0-20%)
2. Planning (20-40%)
3. Clustering (40-60%)
4. Synthesizing (60-80%)
5. Deduplicating (80-100%)

**Tree Building (7 stages):**
1. Starting (0-14%)
2. Fetching (14-29%)
3. Creating Tree (29-43%)
4. Analyzing (43-57%)
5. Creating Blocks (57-71%)
6. Creating Nodes (71-86%)

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Progress Bar Stuck?
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for `[PROGRESS_TRACKER]` or `[GENERATE]` messages
3. Check if updates are being received
4. Verify network tab shows progress API calls

### Proposals Not Appearing?
1. Check console for `[GENERATE] Generation complete, fetching updated proposals...`
2. Verify proposals count is > 0
3. Check network tab for `/api/projects/[id]/proposals` response

### Tree Not Created?
1. Check server logs for `[BUILD_TREE]` messages
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Verify proposals are still in the UI (they shouldn't disappear if build failed)
4. Check network tab for `/api/projects/[id]/proposals` POST response

### Still Having Issues?
Check these files:
- Server logs in terminal where you ran `npm run dev`
- Browser console (F12 → Console tab)
- Network tab (F12 → Network tab)
- Look for red error messages in any of these
